# Look book

Setups to run locally
1. Clone repo
2. Run yarn install or npm install in terminal
3. Once all the dependencies are installed
4. Run yarn dev in the terminal.

 I’ve got the basic functionality in place, but I’m concerned that the UI might not be as polished as I’d like. I had to focus more on getting things working due to time constraints, so I used colors and basic media changes for now.

Here’s what’s working so far:

1. You can interact with the feed using taps and swipes.
2. The media for each Look changes every 5 seconds (currently just a background color change).
3. Once all media for a Look has been shown, it automatically switches to the next Look.
